# Seed Pi 🌱

Seed Pi is a small Linux single-board computer built around the RK3308B processor.
This project was created as part of Stasis, a hardware event by Hack Club.

Stasis: https://stasis.hackclub.com

The goal of Seed Pi is to learn how a real computer is built — from the processor and RAM all the way to a working Linux system.

## What is Seed Pi?

Seed Pi is a custom SBC designed for:
- learning hardware design
- experimenting with embedded Linux
- building IoT projects
- understanding how computers work internally

The board boots Linux from a microSD card and can be accessed using UART or SSH over WiFi.
